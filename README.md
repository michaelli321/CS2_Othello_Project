Caltech CS2 Assignment 9: Othello Mar 2017

We both worked together to understand the board and outline a strategy for our bot. Mike wrote a random player and developed a heuristic to beat SimplePlayer. Alec modified the heuristic and other helper functions to get them to work with a minimax implementation in an attempt to beat ConstantTimePlayer.

Our heuristic is decent and should beat other heuristics, but our minimax implementation didn't go as well as we had hoped. It worked part of the time, but our attempt at doing one more level of minimax was a complete failure.
